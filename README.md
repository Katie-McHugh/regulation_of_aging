### Repository content: 

#### [Data Folder](/data): 

1) filtered_snps.txt contains the "raw" SNP table that was generated using the Burke Lab pipeline
2) filtered_indels.txt contains the "raw" indel table that was generated using the Burke Lab pipeline
3) annotated_snps.txt contains the SNPeff annotations for the generated SNP table
4) annotated_indels.txt contains the SNPeff annotations for the generated indel table
5) founder_states.txt contains the haplotype frequencies for the data
6) design.txt contains replicate identifying information for the transcriptomic analysis
7) gene_count_matrix.txt contains the gene count matrix from the transcriptomic sequencing (notes for generation are contained in the README.md file in the [transcriptomics code folder](/code/transcriptome).


#### [Code Folder](/code)
 This folder is broken up into three subfolders: 
 
1) [**genome**](/code/genome): Code for genomic variant analysis, haplotype analysis
 
2)  [**transcriptome**](/code/transcriptome): Code for differential gene expression analyses
 
3) [**comparisons**](/code/comparisons): Code to compare genomic and transcriptomic data and look into potential regulatory interactions
 
More information on the code within each folder is contained within the [code folder README](/code/README.md)

#### [Figures Folder](/figures)

This folder contains figures used in the manuscript. These include: 
1) _Figure 1_: A manhattan plot of the nuclear genome showing differences in SNPs and indels between young and aged replicates

#### [Tables Folder](/tables)

This folder contains tables used in the manuscript. These include: 
1) 

#### [Results Folder](/results)

#### [Temp Folder](/temp)

This folder contains temporary files used for downstream analysis.  Each file should be generated using earlier code scripts, so these don't need to be downloaded.
 
 #### [Temp Figures Folder](/temp_figures)
 
 This folder contains figures used for preliminary visualization
 
  #### [Temp Tables Folder](/temp_tables)
  
  This folder contains tables used for preliminary investigations
  
  #### [Manuscript Folder](/manuscript)
  
  This folder contains...
